    "### Complexity Analysis: Insertion Sort Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insertion Sort** is the sorting algorithm we implemented to sort the `Year` column in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Best Case**:\n",
    "   - The best case occurs when the input list is already sorted.\n",
    "   - In this scenario, the inner while loop condition `key < arr[j]` fails immediately for every element.\n",
    "   - The algorithm only performs the outer for loop operations, which are \\(n-1\\) comparisons.\n",
    "   - **Best Case Time Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Average Case**:\n",
    "   - In the average case, each element in the list is compared with half of the sorted portion of the list on average.\n",
    "   - The inner while loop executes for about half of the elements in each iteration of the outer for loop.\n",
    "   - The average number of comparisons and shifts is \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{4}\\).\n",
    "   - **Average Case Time Complexity**: \\(O(n^2)\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Worst Case**:\n",
    "   - The worst case occurs when the input list is sorted in reverse order.\n",
    "   - In this scenario, each element must be compared and shifted with all previously sorted elements.\n",
    "   - The total number of comparisons and shifts is \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\).\n",
    "   - **Worst Case Time Complexity**: \\(O(n^2)\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**:\n",
    "  - Insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires a constant amount of additional memory space.\n",
    "  - Only a few additional variables are used, regardless of the size of the input list.\n",
    "  - **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**:\n",
    "  - **Insertion Sort** is efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets due to its simple implementation and low overhead.\n",
    "  - However, it becomes inefficient for larger datasets due to its quadratic time complexity in the average and worst cases.\n",
    "  - Its space efficiency is high, as it operates in-place without requiring additional memory proportional to the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: Best case \\(O(n)\\), Average case \\(O(n^2)\\), Worst case \\(O(n^2)\\)\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(1)\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion Sort is best suited for small or nearly sorted datasets but is not optimal for large datasets due to its \\(O(n^2)\\) time complexity in average and worst cases."
